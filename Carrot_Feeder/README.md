# Printing guidelines
Use typical Voron parts printing guidelines (as found on the Voron Discord). No supports are needed.

For the Filament_Block part, you have the choice to use either the insert version or the no insert version. The M3 threaded insert on this part is tricky to insert, so you can simply screw the M3x16 in the plastic if you prefer. There are no real efforts on this screw, so choose the version you prefer (I prefer the threaded insert).

The support feet are either in 4mm or 5.5mm, depending on the Top//Back plate of your Voron.

The 'dome overhang' on the M4_Gear_Arm is an extreme torture test for the overhangs. It will probably not look good (but if your printer is properly tuned it will be ok). It's ok though, just clean it slightly if need be, you just don't want "stuff" hanging around.

You can use any number of Bearing_Block in your system, and wherever you want in-between your Filament_Blocks. Though the bar lengths from the BOM are calculated assuming you are using one Bearing_Block (of 5mm width) per 3 Filament_Block, starting from 3 blocks (i.e. 0 Bearing_Block for 1 to 3 channels system, 1 Bearing_Block for 4 to 6 channels systems etc.).
