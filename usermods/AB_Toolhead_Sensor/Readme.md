Here you can find "sensorized" versions of the stock AB clockwork extruder.
They all require a couple of printed parts, a standard BOM Omron microswitch, a 7mm steel ball and some common hardware.

It's highly recommended to use the "NEW" version (based on latest clockwork release), but you can still find older version in the "OLD" folder.
