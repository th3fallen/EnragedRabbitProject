## BOM

 - 1 microswitch - a spare Omron from printer BOM is best, but also cheapo no name ones should work fine. 
 -  1 7mm steel ball - any source is fine.  I used a couple from a multisize package for decorative work from Amazon. 
 -  2 M2x10ish self tapping screws - any source wires and
 -  connectors of choice.
