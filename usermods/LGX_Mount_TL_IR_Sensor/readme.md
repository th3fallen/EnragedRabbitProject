This mount is for the TriangleLabs IR sensor.

I Borrowed/edited the sensor cart from the galileo sensor created by Ette.

The mount itself is tested, i also gave it a better fit to the toolhead cooling ducts, just like the original AB had.
The TL sensor still needs testing for fitment and effectiveness, but i have high hopes since I reused the cart.
